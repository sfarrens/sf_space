## Research Interests

Prior to joining the CosmoStat team my work was primarily focused on the optical detection and analysis of clusters of galaxies using photometric redshifts. During my PhD I developed a prototype friends-of-friends optical cluster detection algorithm that was further developed and optimised during postdoc positions in Barcelona and Trieste. I also developed serval metrics and analysis codes designed to compare the relative performance of various different cluster detection codes on Euclid mock galaxy simulations.

I am currently working on galaxy image deconvolution using regularisation techniques such as sparsity and low-rank approximation.
The idea being to remove the effects of a point spread function (PSF) that varies as function of position on the sky. This is beneficial for projects like Euclid that aim to measure galaxy shapes to good accuracy.
